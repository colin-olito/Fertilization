\section*{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Our expectations and predictions regarding the outcome of sexual selection are heavily influenced by the idea that males compete strongly for the fertilization of females' eggs (CITE: Bateman, Parker).
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Indeed, sperm competition theory represents the largest and most influential body of theory explaining observed patterns of male reproductive investment and allocation. 
			\item Classic predictions from SCT include increased ejaculate investment with competition among species, and facultative adjustment of ejaculate allocation within species to better compete for fertilizations.
			\item While the consequences of sperm competition for the evolution of male reproductive phenotypes are well studied in internally fertilizing taxa, and some externally fertilizing fish species, it is unclear how relevant these predictions are for the archetypal external fertilizer: broadcast spawners (\citealt{BodeMarshall2007,Olito2015}). 
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item This is despite the fact that broadcast spawners constitute more than 50\% of marine invertebrate biodiversity worldwide (\citealt{MonroMarshall2015}), represent the ancestral mode of reproduction (), and have long been used as a model for sperm competition theory and the evolution of anisogamy (Parker 1982; Parker et al. 1972).
				\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}

	\item On the surface, broadcast spawning species appear well suited to predictions from sperm competition theory.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Gametes are released into the water column by multiple individuals, often in dense aggregations, ensuring that single males never have sole access to a single females' eggs.
				\item As a consequence, polyandry is extremely common (CITE Levitan urchins and corals, Johnson \& Yund (2007) for brooders), and sperm competition is probably intense for many broadcast spawning species.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item However, several well documeted empirical patterns in broadcast spawning taxa do not appear consistent with SCT predictions.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Phenologies crucial behavioural trait determining local sperm concentrations.
				\item many species exhibit surprisingly long populations spawning phenologies characterized by slow gamete release rates by individuals.
				\item Large males do not necessarily release more sperm than small males, despite having the resources available to do so (\citealt{Styan2003})
				\item Protandry is also common among broadcast spawners, with males releasing sperm earlier for for longer than females do eggs (\citealt{McEuan1988, LotterhosLevitan2010, Levitan2005, BoltonMarshall2007}).
			\end{enumerate}
		\item These reproductive phenotypes are particularly counterintuitive from the perspective of sperm competition theory because males releasing sperm faster should enjoy a fitness advantage by acheiving numerical dominance over their competitors.
		\item Further confounding SCT predictions is the fact that broadcast spawners generally have massive gonads relative to even the most extravagant internal fertilizers (\hl{NEED TO PUT A NUMBER AND SOME CITATIONS ON THIS}).
