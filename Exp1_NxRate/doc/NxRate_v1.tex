\section*{Introduction}

Living organisms, the communities they form, and the environments they inhabit, are all temporally dynamic systems. Consequently, accessing many fundamental questions in biology begins with a consideration of the rates of underlying biological processes. When nonlinearity is of biological interest and accurately represents the biological rate of interest, then nonlinear, function valued approaches may be most appropriate (e.g. \citealt{MarshallWhite2013, Stinchcombe2012}). But in many instances, there is a putatively linear rate that is of biological relevance that we wish to estimate free of artifactual nonlinear regions. In these cases, biologists often reduce experimental complexity by holding state variables constant in order to estimate monotonic rates, which are then used in subsequent analyses. For example, the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) seeks to explain ecological patterns by scaling the size- and temperature-dependence of metabolic rates from individuals to ecosystems (\citealt{Gillooly_etal2001, Brown2004}). The study of MTE therefore begins with estimates of rates of O$_2$ consumption or CO$_2$ production, which are used as proxies for metabolic rate (e.g.~\citealt{Gillooly_etal2001,Brown2004,WhiteMarshall2011,Barneche2014}). Similarly, understanding and predicting the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes, such as community primary productivity, begins with estimates of \chem{O_2} production rates (\citealt{Tanaka2013, YvonDurocher2015}). Other examples include estimates of leaf respiration rate (\citealt{Shapiro2004}), ecosystem functioning (\citealt{RossKeough2013}), as well as components of biogeochemical cycles such as denitrification (\citealt{Song2011}), CO$_2$, and CH$_4$ gas emissions (e.g.~\citealt{Larmola2013}). Thus, accurate estimates of biological rates provide the foundation for many branches of biology but surprisingly, there are few systematic approaches to estimating rates.

Biological rates are routinely estimated from inherently non-linear or noisy time series data using linear regression. For example, many studies in physiology, ecosystem ecology, and biogeochemistry monitor reactant consumption or production in closed chambers at standardized temperatures, and use the resulting, often non-linear time series to estimate the rate of interest (e.g.~\citealt{Song2011, WhiteMarshall2011, Larmola2013, RossKeough2013, Tanaka2013, YvonDurocher2015}). There are several important problems with this approach. First, the data used to estimate biological rates rarely meet the criteria for linear regression to be an appropriate analytical tool. The first measures in a time series are often noisy as equipment/samples/organisms equilibrate after setup, while at the other end of the time series, rates can change because of saturation effects or the exhaustion of a limiting resource. Consequently, linear regression of a full time series can conflate the biological rate of interest with undesired effects, resulting in misleading and inaccurate estimates. Second, common \textit{ad hoc} methods to ameliorate this problem, such as manually truncating non-linear portions of the time series, introduce subjectivity into the analysis, and may reduce statistical power by throwing out useful data. Last, published studies rarely provide both the raw data and the specific methods necessary to reproduce reported results; so the appropriateness of the methods cannot be evaluated by reviewers or readers. The need to estimate monotonic rates from time series data will only increase as technological advances continue to make collection of high-resolution rate data easy and cost effective. This presents biologists with a non-trivial challenge: to reliably estimate biological rates in a way that is statistically robust, and fully reproducible. Here, we describe and develop a toolkit for this purpose.

We introduce the {\code LoLinR} package for R (R Development Core Team 2016). {\code LoLinR} provides an objective and reproducible toolkit to implement local linear regressions to estimate monotonic rates from time series or trace data. We describe the general approach to reproducible and statistically robust estimation of monotonic rates, and the specific methods used in the package. We then walk through three example analyses to illustrate the utility of the package, as well as important analytic considerations and pitfalls.
