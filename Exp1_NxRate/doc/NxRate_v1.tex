\section*{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Our expectations and predictions regarding the outcome of sexual selection are heavily influenced by the idea that males compete strongly for the fertilization of females' eggs (CITE: Bateman, Parker). \hl{leverage fact that SCT started with external fertilization ... where the biology started, and excludes complicating factors such as cryptic female choice.}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Indeed, sperm competition theory represents the largest and most influential body of theory explaining observed patterns of male reproductive investment and allocation. 
			\item Classic predictions from SCT include increased ejaculate investment with competition among species, and facultative adjustment of ejaculate allocation within species to better compete for fertilizations.
			\item While the consequences of sperm competition for the evolution of male reproductive phenotypes are well studied in internally fertilizing taxa, and some externally fertilizing fish species, it is unclear how relevant these predictions are for the archetypal external fertilizer: broadcast spawners (\citealt{BodeMarshall2007,Olito2015}). 
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item This is despite the fact that broadcast spawners constitute more than 50\% of marine invertebrate biodiversity worldwide (\citealt{MonroMarshall2015}), represent the ancestral mode of reproduction (), and have long been used as a model for sperm competition theory and the evolution of anisogamy (Parker 1982; Parker et al. 1972).
				\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}

	\item On the surface, broadcast spawning species appear well suited to predictions from sperm competition theory.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Gametes are released into the water column by multiple individuals, often in dense aggregations.
			\item Consequently, polyandry is extremely common (CITE Levitan urchins and corals, Johnson \& Yund (2007) for brooders), and sperm competition is probably intense for many broadcast spawning species.
		\end{enumerate}

	\item However, several well documeted empirical patterns in broadcast spawning taxa do not appear consistent with SCT predictions.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Many species exhibit surprisingly long population spawning phenologies characterized by slow gamete release rates by individuals.
			\item Large males do not necessarily release more sperm than small males, despite having the resources available to do so (\citealt{Styan2003})
			\item Protandry is also common among broadcast spawners, with males releasing sperm earlier for for longer than females do eggs (\citealt{McEuan1988, LotterhosLevitan2011, Levitan2005, MarshallBolton2007}).
		\end{enumerate}

	\item \hl{Need to be deft, both here and in the discussion, in explaining why we do not do this in a sperm-competitive context, despite the fact that ALL the theory is about SC. The play is: absence of sperm competition is the baseline, selection from environment is expected to be VERY strong for broadcasters, and our results suggest that SC doesn't change the predictions that much.}

	\item 

	\item These reproductive phenotypes are particularly counterintuitive from the perspective of sperm competition theory because males releasing sperm faster should enjoy a fitness advantage by acheiving numerical dominance over their competitors.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Further confounding SCT predictions is the fact that broadcast spawners generally have massive gonads relative to even the most extravagant internal fertilizers (\hl{NEED TO PUT A NUMBER AND SOME CITATIONS ON THIS}).
			\item Apparent disagreements between SCT and observed broadcast spawning strategies may be a consequence strong selection 	from the external environment on gametes during dispersal.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The process of gamete dispersal is characterized by rapid diffusion, dependent on local hydrodynamic conditions, resulting in severe wastage of male ejaculates that never encounter eggs in the water column.
				\item Fertilization success is ultimately determined by local gamete concentrations... sperm limitation \(\leftrightarrow\) polyspermy.
				\item Ultimately, males must optimize local sperm concentrations in order to acheive higher fertilization success.
				\item Crucially, males are able to directly manipulate local sperm concentrations by adjusting their sperm release phenologies. Thus, spawning phenologies represent an important target of selection during the process of gamete dispersal.
			\end{enumerate}	
		\end{enumerate}

	\item The critical question is what are the fitness consequences of different male spawning phenologies?
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Previous theoretical and empirical studieshave investigated the fertilization success of different male broadcast spawning strategies in a sperm competitive context.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item A crucial prediction from these models is that sperm competition should often select for males that release sperm more slowly than females (\citealt{BodeMarshall2007, Olito2015, Olito2017}).
				\item There have been relatively few empirical studies that measure ...blah blah... sperm competitive trials (reviewed in \citealt{LotterhosLevitan2011}), but suggest that males who release sperm slowly, and earlier than females enjoy higher fertilization success than rival males who release sperm faster, and in closer synchrony with females.
			\end{enumerate}
			\item However, very few studies have examined selection from the external environment during sperm dispersal, outside of a sperm competitive context.
			\item \citet{BodeMarshall2007} is one of the few we are aware of that directly manipulated male spawning strategies.
			\item tehy found that males releasing sperm slowly enjoyed higher fertilziation success at two downstream egg patches in a flume experiment than did fast-releasing males... however they did not manipulate X, Y, Z.
			\item Critical gap in our understanding: Fertilization success of more diverse reproductive phenotypes. In particular, how should sperm release rate covary with the energetic investment males are making in their ejaculate?
		\end{enumerate}
	\item To address this question empirically, we conducted two flow-through flume experiments to simulate different male reproductive phenotypes using gametes collected form the broadcast spawning marine invertebrate \textit{Galeolaria saespitosa}. We experimentally manipulated the total amount, and the rate at which sperm was released, and analyzed the resulting fertilization success of two downstream egg patches.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item We found that the sperm release rate that resulted in higer fertilization success depended critically on the total amount of sperm being released. Slow-release strategies resulted in higher fertilization when ejaculates were relatively small, while fast-release strategies resulted in higher fertilization rates when ejaculates were relatively large. We also found that the per-gamete fertilization rate for males decreases dramatically with the total amount of sperm released - highlighting the massive investment required by males to overcome sperm wastage... 
			\item Interesting implications -- predictions from sperm competition agree with our findings for small ejaculates, but in opposition to our findings for large ejaculates... suggesting that small males, or males investing less in sperm production, may experience concordant selection to release sperm slowly. In contrast, large males, or males investing heavily in sperm production may experience opposing selection pressures -- with sperm competition favouring slow release strategies, despite the fact that faster release strategies should result in higher fertilization success in a non-competitive context.
		\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}



\section*{Methods}

	\subsection*{Study species}
	We studied spawning phenologies and the fertilization success of different male spawning strategies using \textit{Galeolaria caespitosa} Savigny 1818. \textit{G.~caespitosa} is a dioecious sessile polychaete worm common in the intertidal zone throughout southeast Australia. All individuals for this study were collected from pier pilings at the Royal Brighton Yacht Squadron, in Port Philip Bay, Victoria. For flume experiments, we used established protocols to collect gametes (e.g., \citealt{MarshallEvans2005a, MarshallEvans2005b}). \textit{G.~caespitosa} sperm become active immediately upon release, and can remain viable for several hours after spawning (\citealt{Kupriyanova2013}). To minimize any effects of sperm aging on egg fertilization success, we ensured that all gametes had been freshly spawned no more than $45$~min before being used in experimental runs.

	\subsection*{Lab spawnings}
	To estimate the duration of individual spawning phenologies in the wild, we documented induced, non-traumatic, spawnings in a laboratory setting. A large \textit{G.~caespitosa} colony fragment was collected on \date{16/11/16}, and stored overnight in a controlled temperature room at the ambient temperature of Port Philip Bay ($17.5^o$C). The large colony fragment was then sub-divided into small fragments of approx.~$50-100$ individuals that were then induced to spawn by heat shock in a shallow sea-water bath. Heat shocking was performed by warming the water bath from $17.5^o$ to approximately $26^o$C in approx.~$10$~min. Individual spawning males were marked and monitored and the duration of their spawning timed. Water in the bath was kept gently agitated, and spawning individuals were periodically flushed with seawater using a 1cc syringe. Individual males' spawning phenology was considered complete when no more ejaculate could be seen leaking from the tube with gentle flushing. Approximately $8-10$ small colony fragments were monitored at once in an experimental run, and we performed $5$ experimental runs resulting in $26$ documented individual spawning phenologies. 

	\subsection*{Flume experiments}
	We performed two flume experiments (Exp.~1 and Exp.~2 hereafter) to examine the effect of the amount and rate of sperm released on fertilization success in simulated spawning events. The flume was plexiglass, $240 \times 96 \times 10$ cm (L$\times$W$\times$D), divided into $6$ parallel lanes, each $15$ cm wide. Filtered seawater sourced from the Mornington Peninsula, Port Philip Bay, was gravity fed from a $20$ L constant head tank into a common head for the flume which in turn fed all $6$ lanes. Water was not recycled after flowing through the flume. During experimental runs, the flume was filled to a depth of $5$ cm, and flow rates were maintained at $\approx 1$ cm per second across all lanes. Laminar flow in each lane was maintained by $10$ cm collimators made of drinking straws located $25$ cm from the head of each lane (\citealt{YundMeidel2003}). All flume experiments were conducted in a Controlled Temperature room maintained at $17^o$ Celsius at the Jock Marshall Reserve Environmental Laboratories of the Monash Centre for Geometric Biology.

	In Exp.~1, we examined the effect of releasing different amounts of sperm on fertilization success at a patch of eggs located downstream from the sperm release point. Prior to running the flume, we collected gametes from $12$ males and $6$ females. All collected eggs were pooled together and mixed thoroughly. Eggs were then divided into $6$ aliquots that were gently released onto the bottom of the flume, in the center of each lane, $5$ cm downstream from the collimators ($25$ cm downstream from the sperm release point). \textit{G.~caespitosa} eggs are negatively buoyant, and the flow rate in the flume was low enough that eggs were not washed away. 

	All collected sperm was combined into a single pooled ejaculate, and thoroughly mixed. $0.1$ mL of the pooled ejaculate was set aside for sperm enumeration using a haemocytometer. The remaining pooled ejaculate was diluted by a factor of $10$, and then sub-divided into $6$ aliquots with different volumes corresponding to $N = 0.5$, $1$, $1.5$, $2$, $2.5$, and $3$ times the average amount of sperm released by the individual males used in that experimental run. Thus, the specific amount of sperm released for a given level of $N$ differed among experimental runs. This was done intentionally in order to harness natural variation in the average amount of sperm collected from males for each experimental run, and sample a broader range of the amount of sperm released, while retaining the same ratios of relative male investment in sperm. Dilutions were performed immediately before initiating an experimental run to minimize sperm aging effects (i.e., after priming the flume, placing eggs, and staring the flow of water). Lane assignments for each level of $N$, and the order in which lanes were run, were randomized for each experimental run to account for any lane-specific, or lane order, effects on fertlization success.

	During an experimental run, sperm was released from a syringe $15$ cm from the head of each lane ($10$ cm upstream from the collimators), in the center of each lane, immeditely above the bottom of the flume. Sperm was released over a period of $15$ seconds, and care was taken to release sperm at a steady rate. After all sperm was released, the flume was left to run uninterrupted for $10$ min before collecting eggs. Eggs were then washed with fresh filtered seawater, and left to develop in polyethelene test tubes for an additional $2$ hours. After incubation, $100$ eggs from each egg patch (lane) were then examined under an inverted compound microscope, and scored as either unfertilized, fertilized, or polyspermic, based on the presence/absence of raised egg envelopes, regular, or irregular, patterns of cell division. The flume was drained completely and washed with fresh water between each experimental run.

	In Exp.~2, we examined the effect of a factorial cross between the amount of sperm released, and the rate at which it was released, on fertilization success at two patches of eggs located downstream from the sperm release point. Wherever possible, we used identical protocols to Exp.~1, and describe only the relevant differences here. Eggs from $10$ females were collected, combined, and placed on the bottom of the flume in each lane in two patches located $25$ cm and $75$ cm downstream from the sperm release point. Sperm from $12$ males was collected, pooled, and then sub-divided into $6$ aliquots with three different volumes corresponding to $N = 1$, $2$, and $3$ times the average amount of sperm released by the individual males used in that experimental run ($2$ aliquots per level of $N$). For each level of $N$, one replicate aliquot was released at a `fast' rate, corresponding to a single pulse lasting $10$ seconds. The second replicate aliquot was released at a `slow' rate, corresponding corresponding to $4$ pulses, each lasting $15$ seconds, spread out over $4$ minutes. Lane assignments and the order of release were again randomized.


	\subsection*{Analyses}
	For both flume experiments, we modeled the number of fertilized eggs ($n$) in a given egg patch as a binomial response variable arising from repeated bernoulli trials, where the number of eggs counted ($k$) in each egg patch corresponds to the nubmer of trials. We analyzed these data using logistic regression in a Bayesian Linear Mixed Effects Regression framework. The number of sperm released was treated as a continuous predictor variable for all analyses. To avoid estimating exceedingly small regression coefficients, and to simplify interpretation, we Z-transformed the number of sperm released for the analyses. Thus, the units for relevant regression coefficients are in standard deviations of the empirical distribution of the number of sperm released in each experiment ($7.9 \times 10^{7}$ for Exp.~1; $8.9 \times 10^{7}$ for Exp.~2). 

	For Exp.~1, we analyzed the set of nested models resulting from modeling fertilization success as a function of the number of sperm released, with random intercepts and slopes estimated for each experimental run (i.e., a random slopes and intercepts model). Thus, the maximal model describing the number of eggs fertilized in the $i$th egg patch in the $j$th experimental run is:
\begin{align*}
	n_i   &\sim Bin\Big(k_i~|~logit^{-1}(\mu_i)\Big) \numberthis\\
	\mu_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1~sperm_i + \gamma_{j}~\times run_j \times sperm_i,
\end{align*}
\noindent{} with priors
\begin{align*}
	\beta           &\sim N(0,3) \\
	\gamma          &\sim N(0,\sigma_{\gamma}) \\
	\sigma_{\gamma} &\sim Cauchy(0,1).
\end{align*}

	For Exp.~2, we treated both the rate of sperm release, and the position of the downstream egg patches as categorical variables. We again treated experimental run as a `random' variable, and explored the nested model set arising from the interaction of experimental $run$ with all `fixed' effects. Thus, the maximal model describing the number of eggs fertilized in the $i$th egg patch, as a function of the $l$th sperm release rate, $m$th egg patch position, and $j$th experimental run is:
\begin{align*}
	n_i &\sim Bin\Big(k_i~|~logit^{-1}(\mu_i)\Big) \numberthis\\
	\mu_i &= \beta_{i,l,m}~sperm_i \times rate_l \times egg~pos._m + \gamma_{j,l,m}~\times run \times sperm \times rate_l \times egg~pos._m,
\end{align*}
\noindent{} with priors
\begin{align*}
	\beta_{i,l,m}   &\sim N(0,3) \\
	\gamma_{j,l,m}  &\sim N(0,\sigma_{\gamma}) \\
	\sigma_{\gamma} &\sim Cauchy(0,1).
\end{align*}
	\noindent{} However, our experimental design did not allow us to fit the full maximal model with all $run \times rate \times egg~pos.$ interactions.

	 All analyses were performed in R v.3.2.2 (\citealt{R2016}) using the Bayesian inference software Rstan (\citealt{Stan2016}). The amount of sperm released down the flume as a continuous predictor variable.

\section*{Discussion}

\hl{need to make the point that if males are constrained to specific ejaculate size for a single mating event... males releasing lots of sperm should do so quickly.  BUT... the massive per-gamete costs of releasing lots of sperm suggest that if males can facultatively adjust the amount of sperm they release, or can release sperm over multiple spawning events, males should always release less sperm, and slowly... regardless of whether sperm competition is present or not. In fact, SC should only exaggerate this effect.}
