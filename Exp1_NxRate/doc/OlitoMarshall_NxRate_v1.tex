\section*{Abstract}

\noindent{} The idea that male reproductive strategies evolve primarily in response to sperm competition has become almost axiomatic in evolutionary biology. However, externally fertilizing species, and especially broadcast spawners, represent a large and taxonomically diverse group with spawning strategies that have long challenged predictions from sperm competition theory -- broadcast spawning males often release ejaculates very slowly, with weak resource-dependent allocation to ejaculates despite massive investment in gonads. One possible explanation for these counter-intuitive patterns is that broadcast spawning strategies are influenced by strong selection from the external environment. Using a manipulative experiment, we explore how male reproductive success in the absence of sperm competition is associated with male enerjetic investment in ejaculates, and the rate of sperm release, in the broadcast spawning marine invertebrate \textit{Galeolaria caespitosa}. We find that the benefits of fast or slow sperm release rates depend strongly on ejaculate size, but also that the per-gamete fertilization rate decreases precipitously with ejaculate size. Overall, our results suggest that male broadcast spawners should always release very little sperm, and slowly. Interestingly, Our results match recent theory developed for broadcast spawners, suggesting that well documented empirical patterns are expected to evolve whether or not males experience sperm competition.




\section*{Introduction}

Our understanding of male reproductive biology is dominated by the idea that males compete strongly to fertilize females' eggs (\citealt{Bateman1948, Parker1972, Parker1982}). Sperm competition theory (SCT) is the largest and most influential body of theory explaining observed male reproductive phenotypes (\citealt{Parker1972, Parker1982,Wedell2002}), and the existence of sperm competition is often an implicit assumption in the fields of sexual selection and sexual conflict (\citealt{BirkheadMoller1998,ArnqvistRowe2005}). Moreover, classic predictions from SCT, such as increased ejaculate investment with competition among species, and facultative adjustment of ejaculate allocation within species, align well with empirical data, particularly for internally fertilizing taxa (reviewed in \citealt{Wedell2002}). 

The resources a male has available for reproduction plays a critical role in determining the outcome of sperm competition because sperm competition always involves some form of raffle competition among competing males' ejaculates \citep{Wedell2002,ArnqvistRowe2005}. Hence, producing more sperm relative to other competing males generally translates into greater siring success \citep{Parker1972, Parker1982,Wedell2002}. This has been demonstrated theoretically, and empirically in both plants and animals, where the interplay between male resource availability (generally estimated by age or body size) and mating system strongly influence the optimal male mating strategy (e.g., dominant vs.~'sneaker' males; \citealt{Parker1990a,Parker1990b,GageEtAl1995}), mating rate (\citealt{Parker1990b,BirkheadMoller1998,Wedell2002}), ejaculate/pollen allocation strategy (\citealt{FriedmanBarrett2009}; reviewed in \citealt{Wedell2002,Zhang2006}), and body size (e.g., \citealt{ArnoldWade1984}). Even sequential hermaphroditism, particularly in animals, is thought to be driven primarily by sex-specific and age-dependent fecundity (\citealt{Ghiselin1969,Warner1975,Warner1988,MundayWarner2006}).

While resource availability clearly matters for males with internal fertilization, and some externally fertilizing fish species, the consequences of male resource availability are poorly understood for the archetypal external fertilizer -- broadcast spawning species. This is a critical gap in our understanding of the evolution of male reproductive strategies because broadcast spawners represent the ancestral mode of reproduction (\citealt{RouFitz1994}), and are a large and taxonomically diverse group, representing more than 50\% of global marine invertebrate biodiversity (\citealt{MonroMarshall2015}). Furthermore, broadcast spawning excludes complicating factors common in internal fertilizers such as cryptic female choice, and have long been used as a model for SCT and the evolution of anisogamy (e.g., \citealt{Parker1972, Parker1982}). 

There are several tantalizing lines of evidence that suggest the consequences of male reproductive investment are very different for broadcast spawners than for internal fertilizers. Superficially, broadcast spawning species appear well suited to predictions from sperm competition theory. Gametes are released into the water column by multiple individuals, polyandry is common, and sperm competition can be intense (\citealt{McEuan1988,Levitan1998,Levitan2002, Levitan2004, Marshall2002}). However, broadcast spawners often exhibit spawning strategies that differ markedly from classic SCT predictions (\citealt{BodeMarshall2007, Olito2015, Olito2017}). Many broadcast spawning species have surprisingly long spawning times characterized by slow individual gamete release rates (\citealt{McEuan1988,MarshallBolton2007}). Protandry is common among broadcast spawners, with males releasing sperm earlier and longer than females do eggs (\citealt{McEuan1988, LotterhosLevitan2011, Levitan2005, MarshallBolton2007}). In some species, large males do not necessarily release more sperm than small males, despite presumably having the resources available to do so (\citealt{Levitan1991,Styan2003}). Although these well documented patterns are counter-intuitive from the perspective of SCT, broadcast spawners often exhibit massive investment in gonad tissue relative to even the most extravagant internal fertilizers. For example, the mean size of gonads relative to body mass in the broadcast spawning brittle star \textit{Ophiocoma alexandri} is more than four times the relative gonad size in cape gerbils, who exhibit an especially large GSI among mammals ($\approx$40\% vs.~$\approx$8\% gonad mass/body mass percent; \citealt{Kenagy1986,BenitezVillalobos2012}). Thus, the relevance of classic SCT to the evolution of male reproductive phenotypes in broadcast spawners remains unclear.

While some studies have considered the evolution of male broadcast spawning strategies from the perspective of sexual selection (i.e., in the presence of mate competition), few have considered the consequences of natural selection (i.e., from the perspective of what maximized fertilization success in the absence of mate competition) (\citealt{Levitan2005}; reviewed in \citealt{LotterhosLevitan2011}). This is an important omission because there is an expanded opportunity for selection from the external environment to act on male reproductive traits in broadcasters, and the absence of mate competition therefore represents the baseline for what an adaptive spawning strategy should be (\citealt{MarshallBolton2007}). For example, \citet{MarshallBolton2007} demonstrated in a flow-through flume experiment that males releasing sperm slowly enjoyed higher fertilization success at downstream egg patches than did fast-releasing males. However, they did not explore the consequences of different levels of male investment in ejaculates. In contrast, \citet{JohnsonYund2009} found rapidly diminishing returns in male gain curves for a spermcasting hermaphroditic colonial ascidian (sperm is released, but eggs are retained at spawning), but did not explore alternative spawning strategies (e.g., sperm release rates). These sparse empirical results suggest that natural selection in the absence of sperm competition may provide a simple alternative explanation for many of the well-documented spawning strategies in broadcast spawners that appear counter-intuitive from the perspective of sexual selection alone. 

Here we use a manipulative experiment to explore the reproductive success in the absence of sperm competition associated with two important male reproductive traits in the broadcast spawning marine invertebrate \textit{Galeolaria caespitosa}: male energetic investment in ejaculates, and the rate of sperm release. We find that the benefits of any one sperm release strategy depends critically on ejaculate size. We also find that the per-gamete fertilization rate for males decreases dramatically with ejaculate size - highlighting the massive investment required by males to overcome sperm wastage. Our results indicate that if males can facultatively adjust the size of their ejaculates, they should always release very little sperm, and slowly. Crucially, this result matches theory developed for broadcast spawners, suggesting that well documented empirical patterns, and especially slow sperm release rates, are expected to evolve whether or not males experience sperm competition.


\section*{Methods}

	\subsection*{Study species}
	We studied spawning phenologies and the fertilization success of different male spawning strategies using \textit{Galeolaria caespitosa} Savigny 1818. \textit{G.~caespitosa} is a dioecious sessile polychaete worm common in the intertidal zone throughout southeast Australia. All individuals were collected from pier pilings at the Royal Brighton Yacht Squadron, Port Philip Bay, Victoria. For flume experiments, we used established protocols to collect gametes (e.g., \citealt{MarshallEvans2005a, MarshallEvans2005b}). \textit{G.~caespitosa} sperm become active immediately upon release, and can remain viable for several hours after spawning (\citealt{Kupriyanova2013}). To minimize any effects of sperm aging on egg fertilization success, we ensured that all gametes had been freshly spawned no more than $45$~min before being used in experiments.

	\subsection*{Estimating spawning durations}
	To estimate the duration of individual spawning phenologies, we documented induced, non-traumatic, spawnings in a laboratory setting. A large \textit{G.~caespitosa} colony fragment was collected on \date{16/11/16}, and stored overnight in a controlled temperature room at the ambient temperature of Port Philip Bay ($17.5^o$C). The large colony fragment was then sub-divided into small fragments of approx.~$50-100$ individuals that were then induced to spawn by heat shock in a shallow sea-water bath, a common technique for inducing spawning in ripe individuals \hl{cite Megumi Strathmann Book}. Individual spawning males were marked and monitored and the duration of their spawning timed. Water in the bath was gently agitated, and spawning individuals were periodically flushed with seawater using a 1cc syringe. Individual males' spawning phenology was considered complete when no more ejaculate could be seen leaking from the tube with gentle flushing. Approximately $8-10$ small colony fragments were monitored at once in an experimental run, and we performed $5$ experimental runs resulting in $26$ documented individual spawning phenologies. 

	\subsection*{Flume experiments}
	We performed two flume experiments (Exp.~1 and Exp.~2 hereafter) to examine the effect of the amount and rate of sperm released on fertilization success in simulated spawning events. The flume was plexiglass, $240 \times 96 \times 10$ cm (L$\times$W$\times$D), divided into $6$ parallel lanes, each $15$ cm wide. Filtered seawater sourced from the Mornington Peninsula, Port Philip Bay, was gravity fed from a $20$ L constant head tank into a common head for the flume which in turn fed all $6$ lanes. Water was not recycled after flowing through the flume. During experimental runs, the flume was filled to a depth of $5$ cm, with a constant flow rate of $\approx 1$ cm per second across all lanes. Laminar flow in each lane was maintained by $10$ cm collimators made of drinking straws located $25$ cm from the head of each lane (\citealt{YundMeidel2003}). \textit{G.~caespitosa} colony fragments for both flume experiments were collected from the Royal Brighton Yacht Squadron between 9/10/2015 and 20/10/2015 for Exp.~1, and between 11/04/2016 and 22/04/2016 for Exp.~2. All flume experiments were conducted in a Controlled Temperature room maintained at $17^o$ C.

	In Exp.~1, we examined the effect of releasing different amounts of sperm on fertilization success at a patch of eggs located downstream from the sperm release point. Prior to running the flume, we collected gametes from $12$ males and $6$ females. All collected eggs were pooled together and mixed thoroughly to reduce the influence of compatibility effects. Eggs were then divided into $6$ aliquots that were gently released onto the bottom of the flume, in the center of each lane, $5$ cm downstream from the collimators ($25$ cm downstream from the sperm release point). \textit{G.~caespitosa} eggs are negatively buoyant, and the flow rate in the flume was low enough that eggs were not washed away. 

	All collected sperm was combined into a single pooled ejaculate, and thoroughly mixed. $0.1$ mL of the pooled ejaculate was set aside for sperm enumeration using a haemocytometer. The remaining ejaculate was diluted by a factor of $10$, and then sub-divided into $6$ aliquots with different volumes corresponding to $N = 0.5$, $1$, $1.5$, $2$, $2.5$, and $3$ times the average amount of sperm released by the individual males used in that experimental run. Thus, the specific amount of sperm released for a given level of $N$ differed among experimental runs. This was done intentionally in order to harness natural variation in the average amount of sperm collected from males for each experimental run, and sample a broader range of the amount of sperm released, while retaining the same ratios of relative male investment in sperm. Dilutions were performed immediately before initiating an experimental run to minimize sperm aging effects (i.e., after priming the flume, placing eggs, and starting the flow of water). Lane assignments for each level of $N$, and the order in which lanes were run, were randomized for each experimental run to account for any lane-specific, or lane order, effects on fertlization success. 

	During an experimental run, sperm was released from a syringe $15$ cm from the head of each lane ($10$ cm upstream from the collimators), in the center of each lane, immeditely above the bottom of the flume. Sperm was released over a period of $15$ seconds, and care was taken to release sperm at a steady rate. Note that this necessarily confounded the rate of release with the total amount of sperm released -- larger ejaculates were released at faster rates. After all sperm was released, the flume was left to run uninterrupted for $10$ min before collecting eggs. Eggs were then washed with fresh filtered seawater, and left to develop in polyethelene test tubes for an additional $2$ hours. After incubation, $100$ eggs from each lane were examined under an inverted compound microscope, and scored as either unfertilized, fertilized, or polyspermic, based on the presence/absence of raised egg envelopes, regular, or irregular, patterns of cell division. The flume was drained completely and washed with fresh water between each experimental run. We performed $8$ experimental runs, yielding a total of $n=48$ observations.

	In Exp.~2, we examined the effect of a factorial cross between the amount of sperm released, and the rate at which it was released, on fertilization success at two patches of eggs located downstream from the sperm release point. Wherever possible, we used identical protocols to Exp.~1, and describe only the relevant differences here. Eggs from $10$ females were collected, combined, and placed on the bottom of the flume in each lane in two patches located $25$ cm and $75$ cm downstream from the sperm release point. Sperm from $12$ males was collected, pooled, diluted by $10^{-1}$, and then sub-divided into $6$ aliquots with three different volumes corresponding to $N = 1$, $2$, and $3$ times the average amount of sperm released by the individual males used in that experimental run ($2$ aliquots per level of $N$). For each level of $N$, one replicate aliquot was released at a `fast' rate, corresponding to a single pulse lasting $10$ seconds. The second replicate aliquot was released at a `slow' rate, corresponding corresponding to $4$ pulses, each lasting $15$ seconds, spread out over $4$ minutes. Lane assignments and the order of release were again randomized. We performed $10$ experimental runs, yielding a total of $n=120$ observations ($10$ runs $\times~6$ lanes $\times~2$ egg patches $= 120$).

	\subsection*{Analyses}
	For both flume experiments, we modeled the number of fertilized eggs ($n$) in a given egg patch as a binomial response variable, where the number of eggs counted in each egg patch ($E$) corresponds to the number of bernoulli trials. We analyzed fertilization success using logistic regression in a Bayesian Linear Mixed Effects Regression framework, with the basic model structure 

\begin{align*}
	n_i   &\sim Bin\Big(E_i~|~logit^{-1}(\mu_i)\Big), \numberthis\\
	\mu_i &= \beta \mathbf{X} + \gamma \mathbf{Z} + \epsilon,
\end{align*}
\noindent{} with priors
\begin{align*}
	\beta           &\sim N(0,3) \\
	\gamma          &\sim N(0,\sigma_{\gamma}) \\
	\sigma_{\gamma} &\sim \mathit{half} \text{--}\textit{Cauchy}(0,1),
\end{align*}

	\noindent where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are vectors of regression coefficients for `fixed' and `random' effects, $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ are model matrices for the linear predictors, and $\epsilon$ is the residual error. Although there is little distinction between `fixed' and `random' effects in Bayesian analyses, this model specification allows for flexible heirarchical structure, and direct sampling of the posterior distributions for all parameters rather than maximum likelihood estimates. The number of sperm released, $Sperm_i$, was treated as a continuous predictor variable for all analyses. To avoid estimating very small regression coefficients (on the order of $1 \times 10^{-9}$), and to simplify interpretation of parameter estimates, the number of sperm released was Z-transformed prior to analyses. Thus, the units for $Sperm_i$ coefficients are in standard deviations of the empirical distribution of the number of sperm released in each experiment ($7.9 \times 10^{7}$ for Exp.~1; $8.9 \times 10^{7}$ for Exp.~2). 

	For Exp.~1, we fit a simple logistic regression of fertilization success regressed on the number of sperm released ($\mathbf{X} = Sperm_i$), with experimental run as a `random' grouping variable. We then analyzed the full set of nested models arising from the $\mathbf{Z} = Run \times Sperm_i$ interaction (with all lower-order interactions included). For Exp.~2, we treated the rate of sperm release ($Rate$, with two levels: 'Fast' or `Slow'), and the position of the downstream egg patches ($EggPos$, with two levels: '25 cm' or `75 cm') as categorical variables, and modeled fertilization success using a linear model of the three way interaction between of the amount of sperm released, the rate it was released, and the downstream distance to the egg patches ($ \mathbf{X} = Sperm_i \times Rate \times EggPos$, including lower-order interactions). We again treated experimental run as a `random' grouping variable, and analyzed the nested model set arising from the interaction of $Run$ with all `fixed' effects (i.e., $\mathbf{Z} = Run \times Sperm_i \times Rate \times EggPos$, including lower-order interactions). We did not drop any of the `fixed-effect' terms in either analysis ($\mathbf{X}$ was identical for all competing models in each analysis).

	Posterior distributions of all model parameters were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods implementing a NUTS sampler (\citealt{Stan2016}). For all models in both analyses we initiated $3$ MCMC chains of $2,000$ steps, each with a $1,000$ step warmup, yielding a total of $3,000$ samples (i.e., $(2,000 - 1,000) \times 3 = 3,000$). Chains were monitored for sampling abnormalities and considered to have reached convergence when all parameter estimates yielded a scale reduction statistic of $\hat{R} < 1.01$ (\citealt{GelmanRubin1992}).

	For both analyses, we implemented a fully Bayesian model selection procedure using leave-one-out cross-validation using the R package \textit{loo} v.0.1.6 (PSIS-LOO; \citealt{Vehtari2016}). For each analysis, we compared the fit of all competing models against one another (i.e., all pairwise model comparisons) using the expected log pointwise predictive density ($\widehat{\textit{elpd}}_{\textit{loo}}$), calculated by evaluating the log-likelihood at each of the posterior draws of the parameter values (\citealt{HootenHobbs2015,Vehtari2016}). For each pairwise model comparison, we calculated p-values for the pairwise differences in $\widehat{\textit{elpd}}_{\textit{loo}}$ using standard errors (s.e.) calculated as described in Eq(24) of \citet{Vehtari2016}, and a normal probability density function. Although this method of calculating s.e.'s is most reliable for data sets with many observations (\citealt{Vehtari2016}), we obtained similar results using Bayesian bootstrapping methods to estimate either the s.e.'s, or to sample directly from the distribution of pointwise $\widehat{\textit{elpd}}_{\textit{loo}}$ differences. For our final analyses, we selected the model with the fewest parameters that also returned a pairwise difference in prediction accuracy that was not significantly different from the best-fitting model ($\Pr > 0.05$). All statistical analyses were performed in R v.3.2.2 (\citealt{R2016}). All data and code necessary to reproduce the analyses are available at \url{https://github.com/colin-olito/Fertilization}.

\section*{Results}

	\subsection*{Estimating spawning durations}

	The mean duration of induced male spawning phenologies was $352.2 \pm 20.0$ sec.~(mean $\pm$ s.e.). This spawning duration was longer than the time taken to release sperm in the \textit{Slow} release strategy for Exp.~1 ($\approx$4 min), suggesting that our \textit{Slow} release treatment in Exp.~2 was comparable to the duration of induced spawnings.

	\subsection*{Flume experiments}

	The probability of successful fertilization increased with the amount of sperm released down the flume in Exp.~1 (Fig.~\ref{fig:fertPlots}; $\beta_{Sperm} = 0.819$, HPD interval = $[0.736,0.908]$). The maximum fertilization success achieved was $0.87$, and rates of abnormal cell cleavage indicative of polyspermy were very low for all runs ($1-2\%$), suggesting that our models adequately estimate the probability of successful fertilization for these data, and more complex fertilization kinetics models are unnecessary. The most parsimonious model included only a single random intercepts term for experimental run ($\mathbf{Z} = Run$; see supplementary Table S1 for all model comparisons). The $Run$ specific intercepts exhibited only moderate variation ($\sigma_{\gamma} = 0.765$), indicating that the flume was generating repeatable results.

	The most parsimonious model from the analysis of Exp.~2 included several interactions between experimental $Run$ and `fixed' effects ($\mathbf{Z} = Run + Run \times Sperm_i + Run \times Rate + Run \times EggPos + Run \times Rate \times EggPos$; see supplementary Table S2 for all model comparisons). We detected a strong $Sperm_i \times Rate$ interaction, such that the probability of successful fertilization increased faster with the amount of sperm released for the \textit{Fast} release strategy than the \textit{Slow} release strategy (Table~\ref{Table:ModelResults}). We also detected a marginally significant difference in the slope for the $25$ cm and $75$ cm egg patches for the \textit{Fast} release treatment, with fertilization success in the distal egg patch ($75$ cm) increasing faster with the amount of sperm released (Table~\ref{Table:ModelResults}; see also Supplementary Figure~S1).

	From our Exp.~2 results, we calcuated the per-gamete increase in the probability of successful fertilization for the \textit{Fast} and \textit{Slow} release strategies (Fig.~\ref{fig:perGamete}). Per-gamete fertilization rate decreased dramatically with the total amount of sperm released for both strategies, but the decrease was slower for the \textit{Fast} release rate strategy (Table~\ref{Table:ModelResults}). Simple contrasts between the \textit{Fast} and \textit{Slow} strategy prediction lines showed that when small amounts of sperm are released, the per-gamete fertilization rate is significantly higher for the \textit{Slow} strategy than the \textit{Fast} strategy (see Supplementary Figure~S2). Conversely, the \textit{Fast} release strategy achieves higher per-gamete fertilization rates when large amounts of sperm are released.


\section*{Discussion}

Since the seminal work of \citet{Bateman1948} and the development of SCT since the 1970's, observed patterns of male reproductive investment and allocation in diverse taxa have been interpreted almost exclusively as adaptive strategies under sperm competition (\citealt{Parker1972,Parker1982,Wedell2002}). However, broadcast spawning species have long presented a challenge to classic SCT predictions by exhibiting counter-intuitive male spawning strategies -- specifically, slow sperm release rates and weak resource-dependent allocation to ejaculates, despite massive investment in gonad tissue \citep{McEuan1988, MarshallBolton2007, Styan2003, Olito2015}. Although there is some evidence that these strategies can be adaptive in a sperm-competitive context (e.g., \citealt{BodeMarshall2007,Olito2015,Olito2017,LotterhosLevitan2011}), the potentially crucial role of natural selection from the external environment in shaping the evolution male broadcast spawning strategies has been almost entirely neglected \citep{MarshallBolton2007}. Our experimental results using \textit{G.~caespitosa} suggest that observed male broadcast spawning strategies are expected to evolve in response to natural selection from the external environment regardless of sperm competition. Two main results stand out from our study which we discuss in detail below: (1) an interaction between the amount and rate at which sperm is released, and (2) a dramatic cost, in terms of per-gamete fertilization success, of releasing large ejaculates.

We found evidence that size- or allocation-dependent sperm release strategies may evolve if males are unable to facultatively adjust ejaculate size, or if they are constrained to participate in few spawning events. Our results indicate that males releasing small ejaculates will achieve higher fertilization success if they release sperm slowly, while males releasing large ejaculates will have greater fertilization success if they release sperm quickly. Although there is some evidence that individuals can facultatively adjust the rate of gamete release (\citealt{Marshall2004}), we are not aware of any definitive tests of whether male broadcast spawners adjust ejaculate sizes at spawning. Some broadcast spawners may participate in multiple spawning events, expending a fraction of their gametic resources in single events, but again, difinitive data is lacking (\hl{XXX, Levitan...}). It is worth noting, however, that participation in multiple spawning events requires that females mirror male spawning strategies, a situation that may not always occur, and environmental conditions may constrain spawning to single events \citep{Olito2015,Olito2017}. It has been demonstrated in two species of scallop that males of different sizes release similar amounts of sperm, despite the fact that larger males could have released more (\citealt{Styan2003}). However, these spawnings were chemically induced, and so provide only indirect evidence for facultative adjustment of ejaculate size by large males. Given its central importance in determining optimal male mating strategies, pinning down the extent to which broadcasters facultatively adjust their ejaculate size represents a fundamental issue for future work.  

Although there appears to be some potential for the evolution of size- or allocation-dependent sperm release strategies, we also found a massive per-gamete cost associated with releasing large ejaculates. The more sperm males release, the more is wasted during the process of sperm dispersal. Moreover, this pattern was not driven by a saturation effect -- none of our experimental runs resulted in complete fertilization, and rates of polyspermy appear to have remained low. While the per-gamete fertilization rate should collapse under conditions resulting in very low overall fertilization success (e.g., very low or very high sperm:egg ratios), our results suggest that for populations with moderate sex ratios ($\approx 2:1$ in our experiments), and intermediate fertilization rates, it should remain high. Taken together, these results suggests that if male broadcast spawners can facultatively adjust their size of their ejaculates, or if they can release sperm over multiple spawning events, the optimal spawning strategy will generally be to release as little sperm as possible, as slowly as possible, during the window of female spawning. Crucially, broadcast spawners incur this cost whether sperm competition is present or not. Moreover, our results suggest that the strength of selection from the external environment during sperm dispersal is likely to be strong, even under conditions that are favourable for fertilization (e.g., laminar, unidirectional flow), while selection from sperm competition is strongly density-dependent \citep{Parker1982,Levitan1998,BodeMarshall2007}. Sperm competition may exaggerate selection for small ejaculates and slow sperm release rates, particularly at high population densities, but selection during sperm dispersal is likely the more consistent force driving the evolution of reproductive phenotypes in broadcast spawners.

Our findings also have interesting implications for the evolution of sequential hermaphroditism in aquatic animals. Protandry, where individuals change gender from male to female, is expected to evolve when female fecundity increases faster with size than male fecundity \citep{Ghiselin1969,Warner1975,Warner1988,MundayWarner2006}. This is because individuals can acheive higher life-time fitness by strategically expressing the gender with the highest reproductive success given their body size -- small individuals acheive higher reproductive success as males, while larger individuals do so as females. Our results suggest that the dramatic cost of releasing large ejaculates may constrain male size-fecundity curves to be quite shallow in broadcast spawning species, making it more likely that the slope of the female-fecundity curve is steeper than the male. This is especially true if males are unable to facultatively adjust ejaculate size, or if they are constrained to few mating events by environmental conditions or female spawning phenologies \citep{Olito2015,Olito2017}. Hence, we would predict an evolutionary association between broadcast spawning and protandry among aquatic hermaphrodites. Empirical patterns of reproductive mode and mating system appear consistent with this prediction. Protandry has been documented, and appears common, among several large groups of broadcasting or spermcasting hermaprhoditic marine invertebrates including gastropods (e.g., Patellidae, \citealt{QuesneHawkins2006}; Calyptraeidae, \citealt{Coe1936}); corals, \citealt{LoyaSakai2008}, sea stars, and sea cucumbers, \citealt{Sewell1994}, and references therein). A formal test of this hypothesis using modern phylogenetic comparative methods would be very interesting.
