# Evolution of male spawning strategies in broadcast spawners

## Overview

This is the GitHub repository for the development of an empirical study of male spawning strategies in broadcast spawning species. The resulting paper has been been published as a short communication in the *Journal of Evolutionary Biology*, and is available through the publisher [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jeb.13403). You can also contact me directly if you would like a reprint. Here you can find all of the data used in the study, as well as all necessary code to reproduce the analyses and the pre-publication manuscript. 


## Citing information

Olito, C. and D.J. Marshall. (2018). Releasing small ejaculates slowly increases per‚Äêgamete fertilization success in an external fertilizer: *Galeolaria caespitosa* (Polychaeta: Serpulidae). J. Evol. Biol. doi: 10.1111/jeb.13403. 


## Reproducing the analyses and manuscript

To reproduce the analyses you need to first run the relevant `loadData_*.R` scripts, followed by the `*_Analyses.R` and `*_FitModels_*.R` scripts. Note that loading the data and fitting the models can take some time. To reproduce the figures for the manuscript, first run the `loadFigData.R` and `makeFigs.R` scripts. Finally, to reproduce the submitted draft of the manuscript, compile the manuscript file `Exp1_NxRate/doc/JEB/FlumePaper_Final.tex` using your default LaTeX editor/engine. 


## Contact & bug reporting

Please report any bugs, problems, or issues by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/colin-olito/Fertilization/issues). If you would like to report a bug/issue, and do not have a github account (and don't want to get one), please send a brief email detailing the problem you encountered to colin.olito at monash dot edu.
