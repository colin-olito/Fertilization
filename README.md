# Evolution of male spawning strategies in broadcast spawners

## Overview

This is the GitHub repository for the development of an empirical study of male spawning strategies in broadcast spawning species. The resulting paper has been been published at *EVOLUTION???*, and is [available through the publisher](LINK). You can also contact me directly if you would like a reprint. Here you can find all of the necessary code to reproduce the analyses and the pre-publication manuscript. 


## Citing information

Citing information for the resulting paper will be made available as soon as possible.


## Reproducing the manuscript

The easiest way to reproduce the manuscript is to clone the repo, run `createFigs.R`, and then compile the manuscript file `Exp1_NxRate/doc/NxRate_v1.tex` using whatever default LaTeX editor/engine you have. 


## Contact & bug reporting

Please report any bugs, problems, or issues by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/colin-olito/Fertilization/issues). If you would like to report a bug/issue, and do not have a github account (and don't want to get one), please send a brief email detailing the problem you encountered to colin.olito at monash dot edu.
